# Tic-Tac-Toe-Application
This Tic Tac Toe application is a thoughtfully crafted project using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and C#. It offers a digital version of the classic two-player game where players alternate marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The application is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, ensuring an enjoyable user experience. Whether you're looking to relive the nostalgia of this timeless game or explore a well-structured C# codebase, this project is ideal for both casual players and developers alike.

The application not only provides a smooth and responsive gameplay experience but also serves as a solid example of how to develop a user-friendly interface with WPF. The code is meticulously organized and well-documented, making it easy for other developers to understand and contribute. Each feature has been carefully implemented to ensure the game operates seamlessly, providing instant feedback to players about the game state, such as wins, draws, or ongoing progress. Overall, this project is a great way to see how C# and WPF can be used together to create a classic game with a modern touch.

## Features

* **Interactive Gameplay:** The Tic Tac Toe application offers a fully interactive experience, allowing two players to engage in a turn-based competition. The user interface is intuitive, ensuring that even those unfamiliar with digital games can easily understand and play. Every move made by a player is immediately reflected on the screen, providing a dynamic and engaging experience. The game board is designed to be clean and uncluttered, focusing on the simplicity that makes Tic Tac Toe a timeless classic.

* **Two-Player Mode:** This game is designed for two players, making it perfect for a quick match between friends or family. Each player takes turns marking a cell in the grid, aiming to form a row of three symbols, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game automatically switches turns between players, and it clearly indicates whose turn it is, minimizing confusion and enhancing the competitive atmosphere. This mode captures the essence of the original Tic Tac Toe game, providing an authentic experience.

* **Automatic Win/Draw Detection:** The application is equipped with an intelligent system that automatically detects and announces the winner or a draw. As soon as a player successfully aligns three of their marks in a row, the game immediately displays a victory message. If the grid is filled without any player winning, the game declares a draw, ensuring that players are always aware of the game state. This feature adds to the excitement and keeps the game flowing smoothly, with no need for manual intervention.

* **Restart Option:** After each game, whether it's a win, draw, or loss, players are given the option to restart the game with a simple click. This allows for continuous play without the need to close and reopen the application. The restart option resets the game board to its initial state, ready for a new round of Tic Tac Toe. This feature ensures that players can enjoy multiple rounds of the game with ease, maintaining the flow of gameplay and encouraging rematches.

* **Code Readability and Comments:** The codebase for this project is structured with clarity and maintainability in mind. Each section of the code is accompanied by descriptive comments, explaining the purpose and functionality of the code. Variable and method names are chosen to be self-explanatory, aiding in the understanding of the program's flow. This makes the project not only a fun game to play but also a valuable resource for developers looking to learn or improve their skills in C# and WPF.
